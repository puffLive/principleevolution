I wanted to thank the amazing DJ/MC duo at my sister's wedding. We were SO impressed by the amazing energy, professionalism, and most importantly fun that you brought to the wedding. You guys were so organized and listened to what the guests wanted - from song to game requests. Hands down, you two were a HUGE part of how much fun the wedding was. We would and will recommend your services again to others; we had so many different family and friends coming up to us raving on and on about what a fabulous job you guys did. We were so happy with your services! Hands down, the most organized and best vendors to work with! - Maid of Honor (Wedding)
